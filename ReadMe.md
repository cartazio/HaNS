#About

This is the Haskell Network Stack (HaNS)
its been languishing for a while and it'd be pretty cool to get it 
working portably on modern GHC 7.6 (across OS X, Linux, and the rest of 
the *Nix family)

It is a *nearly* pure haskell implementation of the protocols, and it'd be cool
to explore adding support for other protocols too! (and evaluating performance
vs other user land networking stacks)
